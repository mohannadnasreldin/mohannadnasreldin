        I am a skilled Software Engineer and Web Developer with a
            degree from the Faculty of Computer Sciences and Artificial 
            Intelligence at Helwan University.  I have gained hands-on experience as a Full Stack Developer during my internship at Flextock, a dynamic company in the fields of Transportation, Logistics, Supply Chain, and Storage. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the real-world applications of technology in optimizing complex operations. I excel in collaborating closely with clients, ensuring efficient project execution. A quick learner by nature, I'm eager to contribute to your team and bring your ideas to fruition. Feel free to download my CV or reach out to discuss
